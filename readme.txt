This is the implementation of a star or particle field using the three.js library, 
inspired by CreativeJS's tutorial. A widget on the top right corner of the screen 
provided by dat.GUI allows the user to vary the color, speed, number, and size of 
particles and shift the view of the camera. The info box on the top left provided 
by the stats.js class gives code performance.
